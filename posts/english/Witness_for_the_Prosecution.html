Everybody back to work.</p><p>23 Sir Wilfrid, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to read you a poem to welcome you back.</p><p>24 Very touching. You can recite it after office hours in your own time.</p><p>25 Now back to work. What&#39;s the matter with you?</p><p>26 Nothing. I&#39;m just happy that you&#39;re your old self again.</p><p>27 Any more sentimentality around here, I shall go back to the hospital!</p><p>28 They won&#39;t take him back. He wasn&#39;t really discharged, you know,</p><p>29 he was expelled for conduct unbecoming a cardiac patient.</p><p>30 Put these in water, blabbermouth! Come on in, Carter.</p><p>31 Look at this room. It&#39;s ugly, old and musty.</p><p>32 But I never knew I could miss anything so much.</p><p>33</p><ul><li>Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.</li><li>Oh, thank you, sir.</li></ul><p>34 I&#39;m not a religious man, but when they carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.</p><p>35</p><ul><li>Why, thank you, Carter.</li><li>Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.</li></ul><p>36 If anything happened to you, what would happen to me, after 37 years?</p><p>37 37 years! Has it been all that long?</p><p>38 Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October</p><ol><li>The Shepherd&#39;s Bush murder.</li></ol><p>39 The chemist accused of putting cyanide in his uncle&#39;s toothpaste.</p><p>40 My first murder trial. I was more frightened than the defendant.</p><p>41 First time I rose to make an objection, my wig fell off. Where&#39;s my wig?</p><p>42 Right here.</p><p>43</p><ul><li>I&#39;ve guarded it with me life.</li><li>I hope it still fits.</li></ul><p>44 I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.</p><p>45 Still, I suppose my head isn&#39;t any smaller.</p><p>46 What&#39;s all this?</p><p>47</p><ul><li>We&#39;ve put it in mothballs.</li><li>Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?</li></ul><p>48 Of course. The solicitors have been breaking down our doors.</p><p>49</p><ul><li>I&#39;ve got some interesting briefs for you.</li><li>That&#39;s better.</li></ul><p>50 Divorce case, a tax appeal, and an important marine insurance claim.</p><p>51</p><ul><li>Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.</li><li>No, Carter.</li></ul><p>52 I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re not to undertake any criminal cases. Your doctors have...</p><p>53 Doctors! They&#39;ve deprived me of alcohol, tobacco, female companionship.</p><p>54 If only they&#39;d let me do something worthwhile!</p><p>55 Sorry, sir.</p><p>56 Might as well get a bigger box, more mothballs, put me away too.</p><p>57</p><ul><li>2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!</li><li>Oh, get out!</li></ul><p>58 Beddy-bye. We&#39;d better go upstairs now, get undressed and lie down.</p><p>59</p><ul><li>We? What a nauseating prospect.</li><li>Upstairs, please.</li></ul><p>60 Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,</p><p>61 I seriously considered strangling you with one of your own rubber tubes.</p><p>62 I would then have admitted the crime, retained myself for the defence.</p><p>63 My lord, members of the jury, I hereby enter a plea of justifiable homicide.</p><p>64 For four months this alleged angel of mercy has pored, probed,</p><p>65 punctured, pillaged and plundered my helpless body</p><p>66 while tormenting my mind with a steady drip of baby talk.</p><p>67 Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.</p><p>68 Take your hands off me, or I&#39;ll strike you with my cane.</p><p>69</p><ul><li>You wouldn&#39;t, it might break your cigars.</li><li>What cigars?</li></ul><p>70</p><ul><li>The ones you&#39;re smuggling in your cane.</li><li>Cane?</li></ul><p>71 You could be jailed for this. You had no search warrant.</p><p>72 In hospital he&#39;d hide cigars and brandy all over the place.</p><p>73 We called him Wilfrid the fox.</p><p>74</p><ul><li>I&#39;m confiscating these.</li><li>Can&#39;t I have just one?</li></ul><p>75 No. Upstairs.</p><p>76 A few puffs after meals? Please.</p><p>77 I&#39;ll do it. Some dark night when her back is turned, I&#39;ll snatch her thermometer</p><p>78 and plunge it between her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.</p><p>79 Oh, no, sir. You mustn&#39;t walk up. We&#39;ve installed something for you here. It&#39;s a lift.</p><p>80 A lift? I&#39;m sick of this plot to make me a helpless invalid.</p><p>81 I think it&#39;s a splendid idea. Let&#39;s try it, shall we?</p><p>82 Out of there. I&#39;ll try it. It&#39;s my lift because it was my heart attack.</p><p>83 Here you are. Simply press this button for up and this one for down.</p><p>84 Carter, I warn you, if this contraption should collapse,</p><p>85 if the barrister should fall off the bannister...</p><p>86 Remarkable. Smoothest flight I&#39;ve had in years.</p><p>87</p><ul><li>Upsy-daisy!</li><li>Once more to get the feel of the controls.</li></ul><p>88 Good afternoon. Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?</p><p>89 I didn&#39;t make an appointment, but this is urgent.</p><p>90 If it&#39;s about a brief, I&#39;m sorry, but we&#39;re full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.</p><p>91 I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll want this brief.</p><p>92 Serious criminal matter.</p><p>93 Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.</p><p>94 He can&#39;t accept anything of an overstimulating nature.</p><p>95 Put me on a diet of bland civil suits. Hello, Mayhew.</p><p>96 Hello. Distressing news about your health.</p><p>97 It&#39;s tragic. You&#39;d better get a man with younger arteries.</p><p>98 If you could just give us a few minutes. This is Mr Leonard Vole.</p><p>99</p><ul><li>He&#39;s in rather a ghastly mess, I&#39;m afraid.</li><li>How do you do, Mr Vole?</li></ul><p>100 Well, according to Mr Mayhew, I&#39;m not doing at all well.</p><p>101 Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!</p><p>102</p><ul><li>You&#39;re dawdling again!</li><li>Oh, shut up!</li></ul><p>103 Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when you&#39;ve something not too stimulating.</p><p>104 Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.</p><p>105 I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but I quite understand. Take care of yourself.</p><p>106 Mayhew! Mayhew!</p><p>107 Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.</p><p>108 Don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t take the brief, but an old friend needs help.</p><p>109 Surely I can give him a word of advice.</p><p>110 Come on, I&#39;ll give you five minutes. No, no, I don&#39;t want you, just Mayhew.</p><p>111 Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!</p><p>112 You go ahead. Start it without me.</p><p>113 This is your fault. You should not have permitted it.</p><p>114 It is not my fault. I distinctly told Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.</p><p>115 Well, if it&#39;s anyone&#39;s fault, I expect it&#39;s mine.</p><p>116 Seems silly to me, but Mr Mayhew thinks it&#39;s very urgent.</p><p>117</p><ul><li>He thinks I may be arrested any minute.</li><li>Arrested for what?</li></ul><p>118 Well, for murder.</p><p>119 Oh!</p><p>120 It&#39;s the case of Emily French. You&#39;ve probably seen reports in the press.</p><p>121 Middle-aged widow, well-off, living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.</p><p>122 Mr Vole had been with her earlier.</p><p>123 When the housekeeper returned, she found her dead,</p><p>124 struck on the back of the head and killed.</p><p>125 Vole seems caught in a web of circumstantial evidence.</p><p>126 Perhaps if I gave you the details you&#39;d suggest the strongest line of defence.</p><p>127</p><ul><li>I&#39;d probably think better with a cigar.</li><li>Of course.</li></ul><p>128 No previous convictions. He&#39;s of good character with an excellent war record.</p><p>129</p><ul><li>You&#39;d like him a lot.</li><li>They&#39;ve confiscated the matches. A light.</li></ul><p>130 The defence may turn on establishing an alibi for the night of the murder.</p><p>131</p><ul><li>I haven&#39;t got any. Let me get you some.</li><li>Lord, no! You don&#39;t know Miss Plimsoll.</li></ul><p>132 This will take all our cunning.</p><p>133 Young man!</p><p>134 Come here, please.</p><p>135 Your solicitor and I feel you may be able to enlighten me on an important point.</p><p>136</p><ul><li>Yes. Thank you.</li><li>Sir Wilfrid!</li></ul><p>137 You&#39;re not in bed yet? Upstairs!</p><p>138</p><ul><li>Give me a match.</li><li>Sorry, I never carry them.</li></ul><p>139</p><ul><li>What? You said I&#39;d like him.</li><li>But I do have a lighter.</li></ul><p>140 You&#39;re quite right, Mayhew, I do like him. Thank you.</p><p>141 Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll&#39;s face if she saw me now?</p><p>142 Then let&#39;s make absolutely sure that she doesn&#39;t.</p><p>143 Splendid. All the instincts of a skilled criminal.</p><p>144</p><ul><li>Thank you, sir.</li><li>Here.</li></ul><p>145 Whether or not you murdered a middle-aged widow,</p><p>146 you certainly saved the life of an elderly barrister.</p><p>147 I haven&#39;t murdered anybody. It&#39;s absurd.</p><p>148 Christine, that&#39;s my wife, she thought I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.</p><p>149 That&#39;s why I went to see Mr Mayhew. Now he thinks he needs a lawyer</p><p>150 and now I have two lawyers. It&#39;s rather silly.</p><p>151 I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.</p><p>152 Only a barrister can actually plead a case in court.</p><p>153</p><ul><li>Oh, I see.</li><li>She shall not even find the ashes.</li></ul><p>154</p><ul><li>Sit down.</li><li>Thank you.</li></ul><p>155 I saw in the paper that Mrs French had been found dead with her head bashed in.</p><p>156 It also said the police were anxious to interview me since I visited that evening.</p><p>157</p><ul><li>Naturally, I went to the police station.</li><li>Did they caution you?</li></ul><p>158 I don&#39;t quite know. They asked if I&#39;d like to make a statement</p><p>159 and said they&#39;d write it down and it might be used against me. Is that a caution?</p><p>160 Well, it can&#39;t be helped now.</p><p>161</p><ul><li>They seemed quite satisfied.</li><li>They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.</li></ul><p>162 He thinks that he made a statement and that&#39;s the end of it. Isn&#39;t it obvious</p><p>163 that you will be regarded as the principal suspect? I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll be arrested.</p><p>164 I&#39;ve done nothing! Why should I be arrested?</p><p>165 This is England! You don&#39;t get arrested or convicted for crimes you haven&#39;t done.</p><p>166 We try not to make a habit of it.</p><p>167 But it does happen, though, doesn&#39;t it?</p><p>168 Of course. There was that case of that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.</p><p>169 In jail for years and they suddenly found it was another chap.</p><p>170</p><ul><li>He&#39;d been innocent!</li><li>Unfortunate, but restitution was made.</li></ul><p>171 He received a pardon, a bounty from the crown, and was restored to normal life.</p><p>172 That&#39;s all right for him. What if it had been murder? What if he&#39;d hanged?</p><p>173 How would they have restored him to his normal life then?</p><p>174 Mr Vole, you must not take such a morbid point of view.</p><p>175 It&#39;s just when you say these things are closing in on me, it&#39;s like a nightmare.</p><p>176 Relax. You&#39;re in the hands of the finest, most experienced barrister in London.</p><p>177 Let&#39;s get this straight. I may have done something highly unethical.</p><p>178 I&#39;ve taken your cigar but I&#39;m not taking your case. I can&#39;t.</p><p>179 I&#39;m forbidden. My doctors would never allow it. I&#39;m truly sorry, young man.</p><p>180 But if you&#39;d like the case handled by these chambers,</p><p>181</p><ul><li>I&#39;d recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.</li><li>Yes. A very able man.</li></ul><p>182</p><ul><li>I second Sir Wilfrid&#39;s recommendation.</li><li>All right, sir, if you say so.</li></ul><p>183 Hold this.</p><p>184 Carter?</p><p>185 I would like to see Brogan-Moore here as soon as he comes in from court.</p><p>186 Sir Wilfrid, I have never known such insubordination.</p><p>187 Not even as a nurse during the war.</p><p>188 What war was that? The Crimean War, no doubt.</p><p>189 You&#39;ll like Brogan-Moore, he&#39;s had excellent training. Under me.</p><p>190 This morning I had no lawyers at all and now suddenly I have three.</p><p>191 We should explain that I have very little money.</p><p>192 I shan&#39;t be able to pay all the costs and fees.</p><p>193 We&#39;ll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.</p><p>194 He won&#39;t get very much. I haven&#39;t had a job in four months.</p><p>195</p><ul><li>What sort of work do you do?</li><li>Well, uh...</li></ul><p>196 My last job was as a mechanic. The foreman kept riding me all the time.</p><p>197</p><ul><li>I took it as long as I could, then I quit.</li><li>And before that?</li></ul><p>198 I worked in a department store, in toys, demonstrating children&#39;s building sets.</p><p>199 Of course, it lasted only during Christmas. Before that I tested electric blankets.</p><p>200</p><ul><li>Electric blankets?</li><li>I suppose you think I&#39;m a bit of a drifter.</li></ul><p>201 It&#39;s true, in a way, but I&#39;m really not like that.</p><p>202 My army service unsettled me. That and living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.</p><p>203 It was fine there, though. That&#39;s where I met my wife.</p><p>204 She was an actress, and a good one. She&#39;s a wonderful wife to me, too.</p><p>205 But I haven&#39;t been much of a provider, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p>206 Somehow, I just don&#39;t seem able to settle down now I&#39;ve come back to this country.</p><p>207</p><ul><li>If I could just put my eggbeater across.</li><li>Eggbeater?</li></ul><p>208 Yes, sir. I, uh, I&#39;m a bit of an inventor. Nothing big, just little household things.</p><p>209 Pocket pencil sharpeners, key chain flashlights.</p><p>210 But my best is really this eggbeater.</p><p>211 It not only beats, it also separates the yolk from the white.</p><p>212 Is that really desirable?</p><p>213 If you were a housewife, you&#39;d see it right away.</p><p>214 The trouble is, I need money for manufacturing and promotion.</p><p>215 I was really hoping that&#39;s what Mrs French might do for me after I met her.</p><p>216</p><ul><li>Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?</li><li>That&#39;s rather funny in itself.</li></ul><p>217 It was 3 September. I remember because it&#39;s my wife&#39;s birthday.</p><p>218 I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,</p><p>219 daydreaming about what I&#39;d buy for her, if I had any money.</p><p>220</p><ul><li>You really like this one?</li><li>Very much.</li></ul><p>221</p><ul><li>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s too mad?</li><li>Mad?</li></ul><p>222 Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to every woman. But you?</p><p>223</p><ul><li>Why shouldn&#39;t you attract attention?</li><li>You think so?</li></ul><p>224 Absolutely. But if I could suggest one little thing.</p><p>225 Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back a bit like that. Show more of your face.</p><p>226</p><ul><li>My bus. Goodbye.</li><li>Good...</li></ul><p>227 You buy that hat. I insist.</p><p>228 Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat - a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.</p><p>229 I&#39;m constantly surprised that women&#39;s hats do not provoke more murders.</p><p>230 Go on, please.</p><p>231 I was only trying to be nice to make her feel good.</p><p>232 I never dreamed I&#39;d see her again. Or the hat.</p><p>233</p><ul><li>But you did?</li><li>Yes, a few weeks later.</li></ul><p>234 Again, by accident. I was peddling my eggbeaters and business was a little slow.</p><p>235 Would you mind, madam? Your hat.</p><p>236</p><ul><li>Oh, it&#39;s you!</li><li>Hello!</li></ul><p>237 It&#39;s your fault, you know. You chose it yourself.</p><p>238</p><ul><li>May I?</li><li>Sure, if you like.</li></ul><p>239 Thank you. It&#39;s such a bother taking it off and putting it back on again.</p><p>240 That chap is Jesse James. They&#39;ve led him into an ambush. It&#39;s not at all cricket.</p><p>241</p><ul><li>Don&#39;t worry, he shoots his way out.</li><li>He does?</li></ul><p>242</p><ul><li>I&#39;ve seen it. I got to the movies a lot.</li><li>You do?</li></ul><p>243 I get restless so I go out. Then I find I&#39;ve no place to go so I go to the movies.</p><p>244 Sometimes I see the same one two or three times. Ooh.</p><p>245</p><ul><li>Toffee?</li><li>Oh, yes, please.</li></ul><p>246 At this time you had no idea that Mrs French was well-off?</p><p>247 No. Absolutely not. We were sitting in the cheap seats.</p><p>248 All I knew was she seemed to be very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.</p><p>249 She and her husband lived abroad in British Nigeria.</p><p>250 He was in the colonial service. He died in &#39;45, of a heart attack.</p><p>251 Please, Mayhew, not when I&#39;m smoking. Go on, young man.</p><p>252 Well, they finally polished off Jesse James,</p><p>253 and after we left the movie she invited me to her house for tea.</p><p>254 I think it&#39;s the most fascinating thing I&#39;ve ever seen. Janet, come and look.</p><p>255 I&#39;ve seen eggbeaters before, ma&#39;am.</p><p>256 But this beats so quickly and it separates too!</p><p>257 It must be cen-trifugal or centrifugal, which is it?</p><p>258 It&#39;s specific gravity, but it whips cream too.</p><p>259 Did you hear that, Janet? It whips cream too.</p><p>260 We must have one. Is it expensive?</p><p>261 Compliments of the inventor, manufacturer and sole distributor.</p><p>262 Thank you. We&#39;ll use it constantly, won&#39;t we, Janet?</p><p>263 Come, we&#39;d better get out of here. Janet doesn&#39;t like visitors in her kitchen.</p><p>264 Ha!</p><p>265 It&#39;s a bit chilly in here, isn&#39;t it? Shall we have a fire?</p><p>266 Why not?</p><p>267 This is a charming room.</p><p>268 Hubert and I collected all these things when we lived in Africa.</p><p>269 Hubert was my husband.</p><p>270 Well, now, there&#39;s a loveable chap.</p><p>271 That&#39;s the mask of the witch doctor.</p><p>272 He wore it when he pulled our servants&#39; teeth.</p><p>273 So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.</p><p>274</p><ul><li>Hubert was so witty.</li><li>Yes, I can see that.</li></ul><p>275 Oh, here&#39;s tea.</p><p>276</p><ul><li>Let&#39;s use our good silver and china.</li><li>Oh, no, don&#39;t bother, Mrs French.</li></ul><p>277</p><ul><li>This is perfectly all right.</li><li>Lemon or milk, please?</li></ul><p>278</p><ul><li>I don&#39;t really care.</li><li>Would you prefer sherry?</li></ul><p>279</p><ul><li>That&#39;d be fine.</li><li>We&#39;ve no&#39; got any.</li></ul><p>280 Oh, but we have. There&#39;s that bottle, the one we bought last Christmas.</p><p>281 If you care for an eggnog there&#39;s a wasted egg in the kitchen ready and separated.</p><p>282 Do sit down. Don&#39;t mind Janet, Mr Vole. It&#39;s just that she&#39;s terribly Scotch.</p><p>283 Oh, is she? I thought she came with the collection.</p><p>284 You know, maybe I&#39;ll take a glass of sherry myself.</p><p>285 I feel like Christmas, somehow.</p><p>286 After that I saw her once or twice a week. She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.</p><p>287 We&#39;d talk, play canasta, listen to gramophone records,</p><p>288 Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.</p><p>289 It&#39;s so weird to think of her now, lying in that living room, murdered.</p><p>290 I assure you she&#39;s been moved by now. To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,</p><p>291 and unsanitary.</p><p>292 Tell Sir Wilfrid about the evening of the murder.</p><p>293 I went around to see her about eight o&#39;clock.</p><p>294 She fixed a sandwich, we talked, listened to The Mikado.</p><p>295 I left about nine. I walked home. I got there about half past.</p><p>296 I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out of court, in the witness box, anywhere!</p><p>297 How much money did you get from Mrs French?</p><p>298</p><ul><li>Nothing.</li><li>The truth. How much?</li></ul><p>299</p><ul><li>Why should she give me any money?</li><li>Because she was in love with you.</li></ul><p>300 That&#39;s ridiculous. She liked me.</p><p>301 She pampered me like an aunt. But that&#39;s all, I swear.</p><p>302</p><ul><li>Why didn&#39;t you tell her you had a wife?</li><li>I did!</li></ul><p>303 But you never took your wife along when you went there. Why not?</p><p>304</p><ul><li>Because...</li><li>Because what?</li></ul><p>305 Because she was under the impression we didn&#39;t get along too well.</p><p>306</p><ul><li>Is that true?</li><li>No! We love each other.</li></ul><p>307</p><ul><li>Then how did she get that impression?</li><li>She just seemed to want to believe it.</li></ul><p>308</p><ul><li>You never corrected her. Why?</li><li>I was afraid she&#39;d lose interest.</li></ul><p>309 Because she was rich, and you were after her money.</p><p>310 Well, yes, in a way.</p><p>311 I was hoping for a loan for my new invention. Just a few hundred pounds.</p><p>312 An honest business proposition, that&#39;s all. Is that so wicked?</p><p>313 You knew it was the housekeeper&#39;s day off?</p><p>314</p><ul><li>Well, yes.</li><li>You went there because she&#39;d be alone?</li></ul><p>315 No, because I thought she might be lonely.</p><p>316 All right, lonely. You and the rich lonely widow all alone in that house</p><p>317 with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.</p><p>318 Perhaps you turned up the volume to drown her cries.</p><p>319</p><ul><li>When I left her she was alive!</li><li>When Janet came back she was dead.</li></ul><p>320 The house had been ransacked! It said in the papers. It must&#39;ve been a burglar.</p><p>321 I didn&#39;t do it. No matter how bad things look, I didn&#39;t do it!</p><p>322 You must believe me. You do believe me, don&#39;t you?</p><p>323 I do now, but I wasn&#39;t sure.</p><p>324 That&#39;s why I subjected your eyes and my arteries to that ordeal.</p><p>325</p><ul><li>I&#39;m sorry.</li><li>That&#39;s all right.</li></ul><p>326 As for things looking bad, they don&#39;t look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.</p><p>327</p><ul><li>Apparently you&#39;ve no alibi at all.</li><li>But I have. I left Mrs French&#39;s at nine.</li></ul><p>328</p><ul><li>By bus or underground?</li><li>No, I walked. It was a fine night.</li></ul><p>329</p><ul><li>Did anyone see you?</li><li>Christine saw me when I got home.</li></ul><p>330 It was 9.26. I know because I went right to work on a clock I&#39;ve been tinkering with.</p><p>331</p><ul><li>My wife will tell you.</li><li>Your wife loves you, yes?</li></ul><p>332 Very much. We&#39;re devoted to each other.</p><p>333 You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a devoted wife does not carry much weight.</p><p>334 People might think Christine would lie on my account?</p><p>335 It has been known, Mr Vole. Blood is thicker than evidence.</p><p>336</p><ul><li>Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.</li><li>So good to have you out of hospital.</li></ul><p>337 I didn&#39;t get a full pardon, I&#39;m out on parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.</p><p>338</p><ul><li>This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.</li><li>How do you do?</li></ul><p>339</p><ul><li>How do you do?</li><li>The Emily French murder.</li></ul><p>340</p><ul><li>Oh, how do you do?</li><li>Badly, thank you.</li></ul><p>341 A mass of circumstantial evidence. No alibi whatsoever. It&#39;s a hot potato.</p><p>342</p><ul><li>Tossing it into your lap.</li><li>Much obliged.</li></ul><p>343 Your line of defence, however, will be lack of motive.</p><p>344 You will agree that we can rule out a crime of passion, hm?</p><p>345 That leaves us with a murder for profit.</p><p>346 If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs French, why cut off the source of supply?</p><p>347 Or, if he&#39;d been hoping for a golden egg, why kill the goose before it was laid?</p><p>348 No motive. No motive whatsoever.</p><p>349</p><ul><li>You find some flaw in this reasoning?</li><li>No, no, it&#39;s very sound as far as it goes.</li></ul><p>350 Well, it&#39;s all yours. You&#39;ll find Mr Vole very responsive and quite candid.</p><p>351 So candid, he&#39;s already told me we&#39;ll have to sue him for our fees.</p><p>352 Oh, we&#39;ll simply put a lean on Mr Vole&#39;s L80,000.</p><p>353</p><ul><li>What L80,000?</li><li>The L80,000 Mrs French left you.</li></ul><p>354 Left me?</p><p>355 They opened Mrs French&#39;s bank vault today and found her will.</p><p>356</p><ul><li>Congratulations.</li><li>L80,000!</li></ul><p>357 And I was worried about a couple of hundred for that silly eggbeater.</p><p>358 I must call Christine.</p><p>359 Oh.</p><p>360 This doesn&#39;t make things look any better for me, does it?</p><p>361</p><ul><li>No. I wouldn&#39;t think so.</li><li>So now they&#39;ll say I did have a motive.</li></ul><p>362 They will indeed. L80,000 makes for a very handsome motive.</p><p>363 I thought you were crazy but now they will arrest me!</p><p>364 It&#39;s not unlikely.</p><p>365 As a matter of fact, it&#39;s quite likely. They&#39;re on their way up now.</p><p>366 I knew nothing about that will. I&#39;d no idea she&#39;d any intention of leaving me money.</p><p>367</p><ul><li>If I didn&#39;t know, how can it be a motive?</li><li>We&#39;ll certainly bring that out in court.</li></ul><p>368</p><ul><li>It&#39;s our old friend Inspector Hearne.</li><li>Chief Inspector as of last month.</li></ul><p>369 Chief Inspector? They must think a lot of you at Scotland Yard.</p><p>370 You&#39;re getting the de luxe treatment.</p><p>371</p><ul><li>Oh, in here, Chief Inspector.</li><li>Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.</li></ul><p>372 That&#39;s perfectly all right. I never object to the actions of the police</p><p>373</p><ul><li>except once in a great while in court.</li><li>Yes, sir, I still have the scars.</li></ul><p>374 You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.</p><p>375 This is Leonard Vole. You&#39;d better search him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.</p><p>376</p><ul><li>Is your name Leonard Vole?</li><li>Yes, it is.</li></ul><p>377 I have a warrant for your arrest on the charge of murdering Emily French.</p><p>378 I must warn you that anything you say may be taken down and used in evidence.</p><p>379 Well, I&#39;m ready. Must I be handcuffed?</p><p>380 That won&#39;t be necessary, sir.</p><p>381 I&#39;ve never been arrested before, not even for walking a dog off a lead</p><p>382</p><ul><li>or having a beer after hours.</li><li>There&#39;s no disgrace in being arrested.</li></ul><p>383 Kings, prime ministers, archbishops, even barristers have stood in the dock.</p><p>384</p><ul><li>Somebody better call my wife.</li><li>I will, don&#39;t worry.</li></ul><p>385 I&#39;ll go too, see you&#39;re properly charged.</p><p>386</p><ul><li>You will see to it that he is well-treated?</li><li>We will.</li></ul><p>387 Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.</p><p>388</p><ul><li>That&#39;s very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.</li><li>I&#39;d better not. It would constitute a bribe.</li></ul><p>389 We ought to be going, Mr Vole.</p><p>390 One thing I&#39;ve learned for sure, never look in a window with women&#39;s hats.</p><p>391 Good day, sir.</p><p>392 Makes a very nice impression, doesn&#39;t he?</p><p>393</p><ul><li>Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?</li><li>Passed with flying colours.</li></ul><p>394 I hope he does as well in the dock. This is sticky, you know.</p><p>395 Of course. The prosecution will blast in with their heaviest artillery.</p><p>396 All you&#39;ll have is one little popgun, an alibi furnished by his wife.</p><p>397 Isn&#39;t that an intriguing challenge?</p><p>398 I think I&#39;d like it more if it was less of a challenge and less intriguing.</p><p>399 Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum. In bed in one minute or she&#39;ll resign.</p><p>400 Splendid. Give her a month&#39;s pay and kick her down the stairs.</p><p>401 Either you take care of yourself or I, too, shall resign.</p><p>402 This is blackmail. But you&#39;re quite right.</p><p>403 For my first day this has already been rather hectic. I should be in bed.</p><p>404 I&#39;d better get in touch with Mrs Vole and have her come over. Will you sit in?</p><p>405 Thank you, no. I&#39;m in no condition to cope with emotional wives drenched in tears.</p><p>406 Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look, waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.</p><p>407 Take me, I&#39;m yours.</p><p>408 Oh!</p><p>409 About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently, especially when you tell her of the arrest.</p><p>410 Bear in mind she&#39;s a foreigner, so prepare for hysterics, even a fainting spell.</p><p>411 Better have smelling salts ready, box of tissues and a nip of brandy.</p><p>412 I do not think that will be necessary.</p><p>413 I never faint in case I don&#39;t fall gracefully,</p><p>414 and I never use smelling salts because they puff up the eyes.</p><p>415 I&#39;m Christine Vole.</p><p>416 How do you do? This is Mr Brogan-Moore.</p><p>417 How do you do?</p><p>418</p><ul><li>I am Wilfrid Robarts.</li><li>How do you do?</li></ul><p>419 My dear Mrs Vole, I&#39;m afraid we have bad news for you.</p><p>420</p><ul><li>Don&#39;t be afraid, I&#39;m quite disciplined.</li><li>There&#39;s nothing to be alarmed about yet.</li></ul><p>421 Leonard has been arrested and charged with murder. Is that it?</p><p>422</p><ul><li>Yes.</li><li>I knew he would be, I told him so.</li></ul><p>423 I&#39;m glad you&#39;re showing such fortitude.</p><p>424 Call it what you like. What is the next step?</p><p>425 Your husband will have to stand trial, I&#39;m afraid.</p><p>426 Will you explain the procedure? Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.</p><p>427 Oh?</p><p>428</p><ul><li>You will not defend Leonard?</li><li>Regrettably not.</li></ul><p>429 My health, or, rather, the lack of it, forbids me.</p><p>430 It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described you as champion of the hopeless cause.</p><p>431 Is it, perhaps, that this cause is too hopeless?</p><p>432 I&#39;ll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It was a mistake to let you come back here.</p><p>433 I should have taken you to a rest-home or a resort.</p><p>434 Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.</p><p>435 Shut up. You just want to see me in those nasty shorts.</p><p>436 Come now, Sir Wilfrid, you must not think of it.</p><p>437 You must get ready for sleep, think beautiful thoughts.</p><p>438 Now, let&#39;s get undressed. Put these on, tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.</p><p>439 After your rest we&#39;ll have a nice cup of cocoa.</p><p>440 Then perhaps we&#39;ll have a walk around the square.</p><p>441 You know, I feel sorry for that nice Mr Vole.</p><p>442 And not just because he was arrested, but that wife of his. She must be German.</p><p>443 That&#39;s what happens when we let our boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.</p><p>444 The government should do something about foreign wives. Like an embargo.</p><p>445 How else can we take care of our own surplus. Don&#39;t you agree, Sir Wilfrid?</p><p>446 All right. Hop in!</p><p>447 Sir Wilfrid?</p><p>448 Sir Wilfrid!</p><p>449 Come back!</p><p>450 Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.</p><p>451 Go on.</p><p>452 I knew when he came home with a pair of green socks she&#39;d knitted for him.</p><p>453 That&#39;s quite natural. I&#39;m sure a jury will find it endearing.</p><p>454 Leonard can be very endearing. He hates that particular shade of green</p><p>455 and the socks were two sizes too large,</p><p>456 but he wore them just the same to give her pleasure.</p><p>457 Leonard has a way with women.</p><p>458 I only hope he has an all-woman jury. They will carry him from court in triumph.</p><p>459 A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know Mrs French left your husband money?</p><p>460 Yes. A lot of money.</p><p>461 Of course, your husband had no previous knowledge of this bequest?</p><p>462 Is that what he told you?</p><p>463 Surely you&#39;re not suggesting different?</p><p>464 Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.</p><p>465 Clearly, she had come to look upon your husband as a son or favourite nephew.</p><p>466 You think Mrs French looked upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?</p><p>467 I do. An entirely natural and understandable relationship.</p><p>468 What hypocrites you are in this country.</p><p>469 Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.</p><p>470</p><ul><li>Do you mind if I ask you a question?</li><li>Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.</li></ul><p>471 You realise your husband&#39;s entire defence rests on his word and yours?</p><p>472</p><ul><li>I realise that.</li><li>And that the jury will be quite sceptical</li></ul><p>473 of the word of a man accused of murder when supported only by that of his wife?</p><p>474</p><ul><li>I realise that too.</li><li>Let us, then, at least make sure</li></ul><p>475</p><ul><li>the two are not in conflict.</li><li>By all means, let&#39;s.</li></ul><p>476 I assume you want to help your husband?</p><p>477 Of course I want to help Leonard. I want to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.</p><p>478 There. Isn&#39;t that more comfortable for you?</p><p>479 Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.</p><p>480 On the night of the murder your husband came home before 9.30. Correct?</p><p>481 Precisely. Isn&#39;t that what he wants me to say?</p><p>482 Isn&#39;t it the truth?</p><p>483 Of course.</p><p>484 But when I told the police, I do not think they believed me.</p><p>485 Maybe I didn&#39;t say it well. Maybe because of my accent.</p><p>486 My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts</p><p>487 we accept the evidence of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian</p><p>488 and who must have an interpreter.</p><p>489 We accept the evidence of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,</p><p>490 as long as they tell the truth.</p><p>491 You&#39;re aware that when you&#39;re in the witness box you will be sworn</p><p>492</p><ul><li>and you will testify under oath?</li><li>Yes.</li></ul><p>493 Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely and did not go out again.</p><p>494 The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Is that better?</p><p>495</p><ul><li>Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?</li><li>Leonard thinks I do.</li></ul><p>496</p><ul><li>Well, do you?</li><li>Am I already under oath?</li></ul><p>497 Whatever your gambit may be, do you know that, under British law,</p><p>498 you cannot be called to give testimony damaging to your husband?</p><p>499 How very convenient.</p><p>500 We are dealing with a capital crime.</p><p>501 The prosecution will try to hang your husband.</p><p>502 He is not my husband.</p><p>503 Leonard and I went through a form of marriage,</p><p>504 but I had a husband living somewhere in East Germany, in the Russian zone.</p><p>505</p><ul><li>Did you tell Leonard?</li><li>I did not. It would have been stupid.</li></ul><p>506 He would not have married me and I&#39;d have been left to starve in the rubble.</p><p>507 But he did marry you and brought you safely here.</p><p>508 Don&#39;t you think you should be grateful?</p><p>509 One can get very tired of gratitude.</p><p>510 Your husband loves you very much, does he not?</p><p>511 Leonard? He worships the ground I walk on.</p><p>512 And you?</p><p>513 You want to know too much.</p><p>514 Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.</p><p>515 Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole. Your visit has been most reassuring.</p><p>516 Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him an alibi and I shall be very convincing.</p><p>517 There will be tears in my eyes when I say &quot;Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely. &quot;</p><p>518 You&#39;re a very remarkable woman, Mrs Vole.</p><p>519 And you&#39;re satisfied, I hope?</p><p>520</p><ul><li>I&#39;m damned if I&#39;m satisfied!</li><li>Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?</li></ul><p>521 That woman&#39;s up to something. But what?</p><p>522 The prosecution will break her down in no time when she&#39;s in the witness box.</p><p>523 This case is going to be rather like the charge of the Light Brigade</p><p>524 or one of those Japanese suicide pilots. Quite one-sided.</p><p>525 With the odds all on the other side.</p><p>526 I haven&#39;t got much to go on, have I?</p><p>527 The fact is, I&#39;ve got nothing.</p><p>528 Let me ask you something.</p><p>529 Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?</p><p>530 Do you?</p><p>531 Do you?</p><p>532 I&#39;m not sure.</p><p>533 Oh, I&#39;m sorry, Wilfrid. Of course, I&#39;ll do my best.</p><p>534 It&#39;s all right, Brogan-Moore.</p><p>535 I&#39;ll take it from here.</p><p>536 I have called Dr Harrison and given him a report on your shocking behaviour.</p><p>537</p><ul><li>Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.</li><li>Sir Wilfrid!</li></ul><p>538 Did you hear me? A match!</p><p>539 Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I&#39;m told you are going to represent me. I&#39;m very grateful.</p><p>540 I struck a bargain with my doctors. They exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.</p><p>541</p><ul><li>Thank you.</li><li>There&#39;s hope that we&#39;ll both survive.</li></ul><p>542</p><ul><li>Get into these. We need a photograph.</li><li>Why?</li></ul><p>543 This is what you were wearing that night.</p><p>544 We&#39;ll circulate a photo on the chance that someone saw you on your way home.</p><p>545 Over here against the wall, please.</p><p>546 Hold it. One more in profile, please.</p><p>547 Do we really need this? My wife knows what time I came home that night.</p><p>548 A disinterested witness may be of more value.</p><p>549 Yes, of course, Christine is an interested witness.</p><p>550 I&#39;ll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.</p><p>551 I don&#39;t understand it. Why hasn&#39;t she come to see me?</p><p>552 Won&#39;t they let her see me? I mean, it&#39;s been two weeks now.</p><p>553 Mayhew, give me the reports.</p><p>554 Have you been talking to her? Is there something the matter?</p><p>555 I want to read a portion of the evidence of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.</p><p>556 &quot;Mr Vole helped Mrs French with her business affairs,</p><p>557 particularly her income tax returns. &quot;</p><p>558 Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms are very complicated.</p><p>559 There&#39;s also a hint you may have helped her draft her new will.</p><p>560 Well, that&#39;s not true! If Janet said that she&#39;s lying.</p><p>561 She was always against me, I don&#39;t know why!</p><p>562 It&#39;s obvious. You threw an eggbeater into the wheels of her Victorian household.</p><p>563 Now, this cut in your wrist. You say you cut yourself with a knife?</p><p>564 Well, that&#39;s true, I did. I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.</p><p>565 But that was two days after. Christine was there. She&#39;ll tell them in her evidence.</p><p>566 Are you keeping something from me? Is she ill? Was she shocked?</p><p>567 All things considered, she took it well.

She had a solid roof over her head and a British passport.</p><p>669 You don&#39;t know her, how she feels about me. You will when she gives evidence.</p><p>670 Mr Vole, I must tell you I am not putting her in the witness box.</p><p>671 You&#39;re not?

Members of the jury,</p><p>701 I appear in this case with my learned friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.</p><p>702 And my learned friends Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore</p><p>703 appear for the defence.</p><p>704 I trust we are not to be deprived</p><p>705 of the learned and stimulating presence of Sir Wilfrid?</p><p>706 My lord, may I assure my learned friend that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.</p><p>707 He&#39;s slightly incapacitated, but will be in his seat presently.</p><p>708 My lord, may I express my regret that Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.</p><p>709 You may, Mr Myers. You may also proceed with the case for the prosecution.</p><p>710 Thank you, my lord.</p><p>711 The facts in this case are simple and, to a point, not in dispute.</p><p>712 You will hear how the prisoner made the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,</p><p>713 a woman of 56.</p><p>714 How he was treated by her with kindness and even affection.</p><p>715 On the night of October 14 last,</p><p>716 between 9.30 and 10, Mrs French was murdered.</p><p>717 Medical testimony will be introduced to prove</p><p>718 that death was caused by a blow from a blunt and heavy instrument,</p><p>719 and it is the case for the prosecution</p><p>720 that the blow was dealt by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.</p><p>721 That&#39;s not true! I didn&#39;t do it!</p><p>722 Among the witnesses, you will hear police evidence,</p><p>723 also the evidence of Mrs French&#39;s housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,</p><p>724 and from the medical and laboratory experts,</p><p>725 and the evidence of the murdered woman&#39;s solicitor, who drew her final will.</p><p>726 I now call Chief Inspector Hearne, Criminal Investigation Department,</p><p>727</p><ul><li>New Scotland Yard.</li><li>Chief Inspector Hearne.</li></ul><p>728</p><ul><li>Chief Inspector Hearne.</li><li>Chief Inspector Hearne.</li></ul><p>729 This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn. I always get it the first day of a trial.</p><p>730 240 above 130. You shouldn&#39;t be here at all.</p><p>731</p><ul><li>I should be in court, the trial&#39;s begun.</li><li>Syringe, please.</li></ul><p>732 Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.</p><p>733 It may interest you to know that I am descended from a warrior family</p><p>734 which traces its brave past back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.</p><p>735 You&#39;re to have a calcium injection daily,</p><p>736</p><ul><li>tranquillising pill every hour.</li><li>I&#39;ll set my wristwatch alarm.</li></ul><p>737 Any pain or shortness of breath, pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets</p><p>738 under your tongue. Oh, and I&#39;ll leave you some...</p><p>739 That&#39;s enough, Doctor. The judge will be asking for a saliva test.</p><p>740 Carter, I&#39;d better take that Thermos of cocoa with me.</p><p>741</p><ul><li>Helps me wash down the pills.</li><li>Let me see it, please.</li></ul><p>742 My learned patient is not above substituting brandy for cocoa.</p><p>743 It is cocoa. So sorry.</p><p>744 If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll, I would strike you.</p><p>745 Take care of this, Carter.</p><p>746 Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom, you must avoid overexcitement.</p><p>747 Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.</p><p>748 Watch your temper. Keep your blood pressure down.</p><p>749 Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe, what with the pills and the cocoa.</p><p>750 Come along, Carter.</p><p>751 From the body temperature and other factors,</p><p>752 we placed the time of death at between 9.30 and 10pm,</p><p>753 approximately 30 minutes before Janet McKenzie returned home and called us.</p><p>754 Death was instantaneous, caused by one blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.</p><p>755 Were there any signs of a struggle?</p><p>756 None. Just the one blow.</p><p>757 Would that indicate that the murderer had taken Mrs French by surprise?</p><p>758 My lord, I must object.</p><p>759 My learned friend refers to the assailant as &quot;the murderer&quot;.</p><p>760 We have not yet determined whether the assailant was a man or a woman.</p><p>761 It could quite conceivably have been &quot;the murderess&quot;.</p><p>762 Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in time to catch you on a point of grammar.</p><p>763 Please rephrase your question.</p><p>764 Yes, my lord. Inspector, is it your opinion that the assailant,</p><p>765 whether he, she or it, had taken Mrs French by surprise?</p><p>766 My lord, I am taken by surprise</p><p>767 that my learned friend should try to solicit from the witness an opinion, not a fact.</p><p>768 Quite so. You&#39;ll have to do better than that, Mr Myers.</p><p>769 My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.</p><p>770</p><ul><li>Is that better?</li><li>That&#39;s much better.</li></ul><p>771 Silence! Silence!</p><p>772 Very well, Inspector, let us proceed with the facts.</p><p>773 After establishing the cause and the time of death, what did you then do?</p><p>774 A search was made, photographs were taken and the premises fingerprinted.</p><p>775</p><ul><li>What fingerprints did you discover?</li><li>I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,</li></ul><p>776 those of Janet McKenzie, and some which later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.</p><p>777</p><ul><li>No others?</li><li>No others.</li></ul><p>778 Did you say the room had the appearance that a robbery had been committed?</p><p>779 Yes. Things were strewn about and the window had been broken near the catch.</p><p>780 There was glass on the floor, and fragments were found outside.</p><p>781 The glass outside was not consistent with the window being forced from the outside.</p><p>782 You&#39;re saying that someone made it look as if it had been forced from the outside?</p><p>783 My lord, I must object. My learned friend is putting words in the witness&#39; mouth.</p><p>784 After all, if he insists on answering his own questions,</p><p>785 the presence of the witness would seem superfluous.</p><p>786 Quite. Don&#39;t you think so, Mr Myers?</p><p>787 Yes, my lord.</p><p>788 Inspector,</p><p>789 did you ascertain if any of the murdered woman&#39;s property was missing?</p><p>790 According to the housekeeper, nothing was missing.</p><p>791 In your experience, Inspector, when burglars or burglaresses</p><p>792 break into a house, do they leave without taking anything?</p><p>793 No, sir.</p><p>794</p><ul><li>Do you produce a jacket, Inspector?</li><li>Yes, sir.</li></ul><p>795 Is that the jacket?</p><p>796</p><ul><li>Yes, sir.</li><li>That is exhibit P1, my lord.</li></ul><p>797 Where did you find this, Inspector?</p><p>798 That is the jacket found in the prisoner&#39;s flat,</p><p>799 which I handed to our lab to test for bloodstains.</p><p>800</p><ul><li>And did you find any bloodstains?</li><li>Yes.</li></ul><p>801 Though an attempt had been made to wash them out.</p><p>802 What tests were made?</p><p>803 First to determine if the stains were human blood,</p><p>804 then to classify it by group or type.</p><p>805 And was the blood of a particular group or type?</p><p>806 Yes, sir. It is type O.</p><p>807 And did you subsequently test the blood of the dead woman?</p><p>808</p><ul><li>Yes, sir.</li><li>What type was that?</li></ul><p>809 The same. Type O.</p><p>810 Thank you, Inspector. No further questions.</p><p>811 Inspector, you say the only fingerprints you found were those of Mrs French,</p><p>812 Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.</p><p>813 In your experience, when a burglar breaks in, does he usually leave fingerprints</p><p>814</p><ul><li>or does he wear gloves?</li><li>He wears gloves.</li></ul><p>815 So the absence of fingerprints in a robbery</p><p>816</p><ul><li>would hardly surprise you?</li><li>No, sir.</li></ul><p>817 Can&#39;t we surmise the burglar might have entered a presumably empty house,</p><p>818 suddenly encountered Mrs French and struck her,</p><p>819 then, realising she was dead, fled without taking anything?</p><p>820 I submit, my lord, that it is entirely impossible</p><p>821 to guess what went on in the mind of some entirely imaginary burglar.</p><p>822 With or without gloves.</p><p>823 Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid, but confine ourselves to facts.</p><p>824 Inspector, when you questioned the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,</p><p>825 did he not show you a recently-healed scar on his wrist,</p><p>826</p><ul><li>saying he had cut himself slicing bread?</li><li>Yes, sir, that is what he said.</li></ul><p>827 And were you not told the same thing by his wife?</p><p>828</p><ul><li>Yes, sir. But afterwards...</li><li>Just a simple yes or no, please.</li></ul><p>829 Did the prisoner&#39;s wife show you a knife</p><p>830 and tell you that her husband had cut his wrist while slicing bread?</p><p>831</p><ul><li>Yes, sir.</li><li>I will ask you to examine this knife.</li></ul><p>832 Just test the edge of it with your finger. Carefully!</p><p>833 You agree that the point and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?</p><p>834</p><ul><li>Yes, sir.</li><li>Now, if such a knife were to slip,</li></ul><p>835 might it not inflict a cut that would bleed profusely?</p><p>836 Yes, sir, it might.</p><p>837 Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains on the prisoner&#39;s jacket were analysed,</p><p>838 as was the blood of Mrs French, and they were both found to be of group O.</p><p>839</p><ul><li>That is correct.</li><li>However,</li></ul><p>840 if the prisoner&#39;s blood were also of this same group,</p><p>841 then the stains on his jacket may well have resulted</p><p>842 from the household accident he described to you.</p><p>843 Yes, sir.</p><p>844 Did you examine the prisoner&#39;s blood, Inspector?</p><p>845 No, sir.</p><p>846 I have here a certificate</p><p>847 stating that Leonard Stephen Vole is a blood donor</p><p>848 at the North London Hospital.</p><p>849 And that his blood is group O.</p><p>850 Thank you, Inspector.</p><p>851 Inspector, granted that the cut on the wrist was caused by that knife,</p><p>852 is there anything to show whether it was an accident</p><p>853 or done deliberately after the murder to account for the bloodstains?</p><p>854</p><ul><li>Oh, really, my lord!</li><li>I withdraw the question.</li></ul><p>855 You may stand down.</p><p>856</p><ul><li>Call Janet McKenzie.</li><li>Janet McKenzie.</li></ul><p>857</p><ul><li>Janet McKenzie.</li><li>Janet McKenzie.</li></ul><p>858 I swear by Almighty God that the evidence...</p><p>859 ...the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</p><p>860 Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.</p><p>861</p><ul><li>Your name is Janet McKenzie?</li><li>Aye, that&#39;s my name.</li></ul><p>862</p><ul><li>When did you first come to London?</li><li>That was many years ago. 28 years ago.</li></ul><p>863</p><ul><li>Where do you live?</li><li>Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,</li></ul><p>864 I&#39;ve moved in with my niece at 19 Glenister Road.</p><p>865 You were companion-housekeeper to the late Mrs Emily French?</p><p>866 I was her housekeeper! I&#39;ve no opinion of companions,</p><p>867 poor feckless bodies, afraid of a bit of honest domestic work.</p><p>868 I meant you were on friendly terms, not altogether those of mistress and servant.</p><p>869 Aye. Ten years I was with her and looked after her.</p><p>870 She knew me and she trusted me.</p><p>871 Many&#39;s the time I prevented her doing a foolish thing.</p><p>872 Please tell us, in your own words, about the events of the evening of October 14.</p><p>873 It was a Friday and my night out. I was going to see my niece at Glenister Road,</p><p>874 which is about five minutes&#39; walk. I left the house at half past seven.</p><p>875 I promised to take her a dress pattern that she admired.</p><p>876</p><ul><li>Och, is this thing necessary?</li><li>An excellent question.</li></ul><p>877 However, it has been installed at considerable expense to the taxpayers,</p><p>878 so let us take advantage of it. Please continue.</p><p>879 Well, when I got to my niece&#39;s, I found I&#39;d left the pattern behind.</p><p>880 So after supper I slipped back to get it as it was no distance.</p><p>881 I got back to the house at 25 past 9.</p><p>882 I let myself in and went upstairs to my room.</p><p>883 As I passed the sitting room, I heard the prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.</p><p>884 No, it wasn&#39;t me! It wasn&#39;t my voice!</p><p>885 Talking and laughing they were.</p><p>886 But it was no business of mine, so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.</p><p>887 Now, let us be very exact as to the time.</p><p>888 You say that you re-entered the house at 25 past 9?</p><p>889 Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my room next to my clock so I saw the time.</p><p>890</p><ul><li>And it was 25 past 9.</li><li>Go on, please.</li></ul><p>891 I went back to my niece. Och, she was delighted with the pattern. Si...</p><p>892 Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 11, then I said good night and I come home.</p><p>893 I went into the sitting room to see if the mistress wanted anything</p><p>894 before she went to bed.</p><p>895 And there she was, dead. And everything tossed hither and thither.</p><p>896 Did you really think that a burglary had been committed?</p><p>897 My lord, I must protest!</p><p>898 I will not allow that question to be answered, Mr Myers.</p><p>899 Miss McKenzie, were you aware that Leonard Vole was a married man?</p><p>900 No, indeed. And neither was the mistress.</p><p>901</p><ul><li>Janet!</li><li>My lord, I must object.</li></ul><p>902 What Mrs French knew or did not know is pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie&#39;s part.</p><p>903 Let me put it this way. You formed the opinion</p><p>904 that Mrs French thought Leonard Vole was a single man?</p><p>905</p><ul><li>Have you any facts to support this?</li><li>The books that she ordered.</li></ul><p>906 A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, and the one about Disraeli and his wife.</p><p>907 Both of them about women that married men years younger than themselves. Oh!</p><p>908</p><ul><li>I knew what she was thinking.</li><li>I&#39;m afraid we cannot admit that.</li></ul><p>909 Why?</p><p>910 Members of the jury, it is possible for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli</p><p>911 without contemplating marriage with a man younger than herself.</p><p>912 Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs French made to dispose of her money?</p><p>913 She had her old will revoked and a new one drawn up.</p><p>914 I heard her calling Mr Stokes, her solicitor.</p><p>915 He was there at the time. The prisoner, I mean.</p><p>916 You heard Mrs French and the prisoner discussing her new will?</p><p>917 Yes. He was to have all her money, she told him,</p><p>918 as she had no near relations nor anybody that meant to her what he did.</p><p>919</p><ul><li>When did this take place?</li><li>On October 8.</li></ul><p>920 One week to the day before she was murdered.</p><p>921 Thank you. That concludes my examination.</p><p>922 Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.</p><p>923 Would you...? Thank you.</p><p>924 Miss McKenzie, you have given evidence about two wills.</p><p>925 In the old will, that which was revoked,</p><p>926 were you not to receive the bulk of Mrs French&#39;s estate?</p><p>927 That&#39;s so.</p><p>928 Whereas in the new will, except for a bequest to you of a small annuity,</p><p>929 the principal beneficiary is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.</p><p>930 It&#39;ll be a wicked injustice if he ever touches a penny of that money.</p><p>931 It is entirely understandable that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.</p><p>932 I&#39;m not antagonistic to him.</p><p>933 He&#39;s a shiftless, scheming rascal. But I&#39;m not antagonistic to him.</p><p>934 I suggest you formed this opinion</p><p>935 because his friendship with Mrs French cost you the bulk of her estate.</p><p>936</p><ul><li>I&#39;ve never liked him.</li><li>Your candour is refreshing.</li></ul><p>937 Now. On the night of October 14</p><p>938 you say you heard the prisoner and Mrs French talking together.</p><p>939</p><ul><li>What did you hear them say?</li><li>I didn&#39;t hear what they actually said.</li></ul><p>940 You mean you only heard the voices?</p><p>941</p><ul><li>The murmur of voices?</li><li>They were laughing.</li></ul><p>942 What makes you say the man&#39;s voice was Leonard Vole&#39;s?</p><p>943</p><ul><li>I know his voice well enough.</li><li>The door was closed, was it not?</li></ul><p>944</p><ul><li>Aye, that&#39;s so.</li><li>You were in a hurry to get the pattern</li></ul><p>945 so you probably walked quickly past the closed door,</p><p>946 yet you are sure you heard Leonard Vole&#39;s voice?</p><p>947 I was there long enough to hear what I heard.</p><p>948 Come, I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t wish to suggest to the jury that you were eavesdropping.</p><p>949 It was him in there. Who else could it have been?</p><p>950 What you mean is that you wanted it to be him. That&#39;s the way your mind worked.</p><p>951 Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes watch television in the evening?</p><p>952 Yes. She was fond of a talk or a good play.</p><p>953 Wasn&#39;t it possible when you returned home and passed the door,</p><p>954 what you really heard was the television</p><p>955 and a man and woman&#39;s voices and laughter?</p><p>956 There was a play called Lover&#39;s Leap on the television that night.</p><p>957</p><ul><li>It was not the television.</li><li>Oh, why not?</li></ul><p>958 Because the television was away being repaired that week, that&#39;s why.</p><p>959 Silence! Silence!</p><p>960 Odd. It&#39;s not time yet.</p><p>961 If my learned friend has no further questions, I&#39;d like...</p><p>962 I have not quite finished.</p><p>963 You are registered, are you not, under the National Health Insurance Act?</p><p>964 Aye, that&#39;s so. Four and sixpence I pay out every week.</p><p>965 That&#39;s a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay.</p><p>966 I am sure that many agree with you.</p><p>967 Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply to the National Health Insurance for...</p><p>968</p><ul><li>... a hearing aid?</li><li>For... for what?</li></ul><p>969 I protest against the way in which this question was put!</p><p>970 I will repeat the question, my lord.</p><p>971 I asked you in a normal tone of voice, audible to everyone in open court,</p><p>972 did you apply to the National Health Insurance for a hearing aid?</p><p>973 Yes, I did.</p><p>974</p><ul><li>Did you get it?</li><li>Not yet.</li></ul><p>975 However, you state that you walked past a door, which is four inches of solid oak,</p><p>976 you heard voices, and you are willing to swear</p><p>977 that you could distinguish the voice of...</p><p>978 ...the prisoner, Leonard Vole.</p><p>979 Who? Who?</p><p>980 No further questions.</p><p>981 Och, maybe you could help me, Your Lordship.</p><p>982 Six months ago I applied for my hearing aid, and I&#39;m still waiting for it.</p><p>983 My dear Miss McKenzie, considering the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,</p><p>984 you are missing very little. You may stand down now.</p><p>985 Call Police Constable Jeffries.</p><p>986</p><ul><li>Police Constable Jeffries.</li><li>Police Constable Jeffries.</li></ul><p>987 I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give</p><p>988 shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</p><p>989 Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?</p><p>990 No, my lord. I now call the final witness for the prosecution, Christine Helm.</p><p>991</p><ul><li>Christine Helm!</li><li>Christine Helm.</li></ul><p>992 Christine.</p><p>993 I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give</p><p>994 shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</p><p>995 My lord, I have the most serious objection</p><p>996 to this witness being summoned, as she is the wife of the prisoner.</p><p>997 I call my learned friend&#39;s attention</p><p>998 to the fact that I summoned not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.</p><p>999</p><ul><li>Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?</li><li>Yes. Christine Helm.</li></ul><p>1000 And you have been living as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?</p><p>1001</p><ul><li>Yes.</li><li>Are you actually his wife?</li></ul><p>1002 No.</p><p>1003 I went through a marriage ceremony with him, but I already had a husband.</p><p>1004</p><ul><li>He&#39;s still alive.</li><li>Christine, that&#39;s not true!</li></ul><p>1005 There is proof of a marriage between the witness and the prisoner,</p><p>1006 but is there any proof of a so-called previous marriage?</p><p>1007 My lord, the so-called previous marriage is, in fact, well-documented.</p><p>1008 Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,</p><p>1009 the ceremony having taken place in Breslau on 18 April 1942?</p><p>1010 Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.</p><p>1011 I don&#39;t see any reason why this witness should not be qualified to give evidence.</p><p>1012 You&#39;re willing to give evidence against the man you&#39;ve been calling your husband?</p><p>1013 Yes.</p><p>1014 You stated to the police that on the night that Mrs French was murdered,</p><p>1015 Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30 and returned at 25 minutes past 9.</p><p>1016 Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?</p><p>1017 No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.</p><p>1018 Christine, what are you saying? It&#39;s not true. You know it&#39;s not true!</p><p>1019 Silence!</p><p>1020 I must have silence.</p><p>1021 As your counsel will tell you, Vole, you will very shortly</p><p>1022 have an opportunity of speaking in your own defence.</p><p>1023 Leonard Vole returned, you say, at ten minutes past ten.</p><p>1024</p><ul><li>And what happened next?</li><li>He was breathing hard, very excited.</li></ul><p>1025 He threw off his coat and examined the sleeves.</p><p>1026 Then he told me to wash the cuffs.</p><p>1027</p><ul><li>They had blood on them.</li><li>Go on.</li></ul><p>1028</p><ul><li>I said &quot;What have you done?&quot;</li><li>What did the prisoner say?</li></ul><p>1029 He said &quot;I&#39;ve killed her. &quot;</p><p>1030 Christine! Why are you lying? Why are you saying these things?</p><p>1031</p><ul><li>What an awful woman.</li><li>She&#39;s evil. I&#39;ve known it all along.</li></ul><p>1032 If the defence so desires, I will adjourn for a short time</p><p>1033 so that the prisoner may gain control of himself.</p><p>1034 My lord is most gracious, but pray let the witness continue.</p><p>1035 We are all of us caught up in the suspense of this horror fiction.</p><p>1036 To have to hear it in instalments might prove unendurable.</p><p>1037</p><ul><li>Proceed, Mr Myers.</li><li>Mrs Helm,</li></ul><p>1038 when the prisoner said &quot;I have killed her&quot;, did you know to whom he referred?</p><p>1039 It was that woman he had been seeing so often.</p><p>1040 When questioned by the police, you told them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.</p><p>1041 Yes. Because Leonard asked me to say that.</p><p>1042 But you&#39;ve changed your story now. Why?</p><p>1043 I cannot go on lying to save him.</p><p>1044 I said to the police what he wanted because I&#39;m grateful to him.</p><p>1045 He married me and brought me to this country.</p><p>1046 What he has asked me to do I have because I was grateful.</p><p>1047 It was not because he was your husband and you loved him?</p><p>1048 I never loved him.</p><p>1049 It was gratitude, then, that prompted you to give him an alibi</p><p>1050</p><ul><li>in your statement to the police?</li><li>That is it. Exactly.</li></ul><p>1051</p><ul><li>But now you think it was wrong to do so.</li><li>Because it is murder.</li></ul><p>1052 That woman, she was a harmless old fool,</p><p>1053 and he makes of me an accomplice to the murder.</p><p>1054 I cannot come into court and swear that he was with me at the time it was done.</p><p>1055 I cannot do it! I cannot do it!</p><p>1056 Then this is the truth?</p><p>1057 That Leonard Vole returned that night at ten minutes past ten,</p><p>1058 he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,</p><p>1059 and that he said to you &quot;I have killed her&quot;?</p><p>1060 That is the truth.</p><p>1061 That is the truth, before God?</p><p>1062 That is the truth.</p><p>1063 Thank you.</p><p>1064 Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm, which do you prefer to be called?</p><p>1065</p><ul><li>It does not matter.</li><li>Does it not?</li></ul><p>1066 In this country we are inclined to take a rather more serious view of marriage.</p><p>1067 However, it would appear that when you first met the prisoner in Hamburg</p><p>1068</p><ul><li>you lied to him about your marital status.</li><li>I wanted to get out of Germany, so...</li></ul><p>1069 You lied, did you not? Just yes or no, please.</p><p>1070</p><ul><li>Yes.</li><li>Thank you.</li></ul><p>1071 And in arranging the marriage, you lied to the authorities?</p><p>1072 I, um, did not tell the truth to the authorities.</p><p>1073</p><ul><li>You lied to them?</li><li>Yes.</li></ul><p>1074 And in the ceremony, when you swore to love, honour and cherish your husband,</p><p>1075</p><ul><li>that too was a lie?</li><li>Yes.</li></ul><p>1076 And when the police questioned you about this wretched man</p><p>1077 who believed himself married and loved,</p><p>1078</p><ul><li>you told them...</li><li>I told them what he wanted me to.</li></ul><p>1079 You told them that he was at home with you at 25 minutes past 9,</p><p>1080</p><ul><li>and now you say that that was a lie?</li><li>Yes, a lie!</li></ul><p>1081 And when you said that he had accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?</p><p>1082</p><ul><li>Yes!</li><li>And today you told a new story entirely.</li></ul><p>1083 The question is, Frau Helm, were you lying then, are you lying now?</p><p>1084 Or are you not, in fact, a chronic and habitual liar?!</p><p>1085 Carter, Carter! The other pill. Under the tongue.</p><p>1086 My lord, is my learned friend to be allowed to bully and insult the witness?</p><p>1087 Mr Myers, this is a capital charge and, within the bounds of reason,</p><p>1088 I should like the defence to have every latitude.</p><p>1089 My lord, may I also remind my learned friend</p><p>1090 that his witness, by her own admission, has already violated so many oaths</p><p>1091 that I am surprised the Testament did not leap from her hand</p><p>1092 when she was sworn here today.</p><p>1093 I doubt if anything is to be gained by questioning you any further.</p><p>1094 That will be all, Frau Helm.</p><p>1095 Mrs Helm, I presume you know the meaning of the English word &quot;perjury&quot;?</p><p>1096</p><ul><li>In German, the word is Meineid.</li><li>Yes. Meineid.</li></ul><p>1097 It means to swear falsely under oath.</p><p>1098 And are you aware, Mrs Helm,</p><p>1099 that the penalty in this country for perjury is a heavy term of imprisonment?</p><p>1100 Yes, I&#39;m aware.</p><p>1101 Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more, is the evidence that you have given</p><p>1102 the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</p><p>1103 So help me, God.</p><p>1104 Then that, my lord, is the case for the prosecution.</p><p>1105</p><ul><li>Want a tissue?</li><li>Yes, thanks.</li></ul><p>1106 It&#39;s the first murder trial I&#39;ve ever been to. It&#39;s terrible.</p><p>1107 Silence.</p><p>1108 Sir Wilfrid. Are you ready for the defence?</p><p>1109 My lord, members of the jury,</p><p>1110 the prosecution has very ably presented against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,</p><p>1111 a case with the most overwhelming circumstantial evidence.</p><p>1112 Among the witnesses you have heard Chief Inspector Hearne,</p><p>1113 who has given his testimony in a fair and impartial manner, as he always does.</p><p>1114 He has put before you a clever theory of how this crime was committed.</p><p>1115 Whether it is theory or actual fact, however,</p><p>1116 you will decide for yourselves.</p><p>1117 And then you have heard the evidence of Janet McKenzie,</p><p>1118 a worthy and devoted housekeeper who has suffered two most grievous losses.</p><p>1119 One, the death of her beloved mistress</p><p>1120 and, second, in being deprived of an inheritance of L80,000,</p><p>1121 which she&#39;d fully expected to receive.</p><p>1122 I will not comment further on her evidence,</p><p>1123 but will express only my deepest sympathy for her</p><p>1124 in both these... mishaps.</p><p>1125 And most damaging of all, the prosecution has produced a surprise witness,</p><p>1126 one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner brought from the rubble of her homeland</p><p>1127 to the safety of this country, giving her his love and the protection of his name.</p><p>1128 I objected to her testimony because a wife cannot give evidence</p><p>1129 harmful to her husband.</p><p>1130 But it has been proven that her marriage to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.</p><p>1131 Therefore, her evidence must be admitted and you must consider it.</p><p>1132 For what it is worth.</p><p>1133 Such is the prosecution&#39;s case. Now it is the turn of the defence.</p><p>1134 We could present, on behalf of the prisoner, witnesses to his character,</p><p>1135 his war record, the lack of criminal or evil association in his past.</p><p>1136 However, only one witness can shed new light</p><p>1137 on this tragic riddle.</p><p>1138 The prisoner himself.</p><p>1139 Members of the jury,</p><p>1140 I call Leonard Stephen Vole.</p><p>1141 I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I give will be the truth,</p><p>1142</p><ul><li>the whole truth and nothing but the truth.</li><li>No.</li></ul><p>1143</p><ul><li>Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?</li><li>It is.</li></ul><p>1144</p><ul><li>Where do live?</li><li>620 Edgware Road.</li></ul><p>1145 Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did you not on the night of October 14 last,</p><p>1146 murder Emily Jane French?</p><p>1147</p><ul><li>I did not.</li><li>Thank you, that will be all.</li></ul><p>1148 Have you, in fact, concluded your examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?</p><p>1149 The prisoner has endured three days of profound mental agony and shock.</p><p>1150 The defence feels his faculties should be spared</p><p>1151 for the cross-examination by my learned friend for the prosecution.</p><p>1152 This is not a plea for any indulgence.</p><p>1153 I am confident that no matter how searching this may be,</p><p>1154 the prisoner will withstand it.</p><p>1155 At the time you made the acquaintance of Mrs French, were you employed?</p><p>1156</p><ul><li>No, sir.</li><li>How much money did you have?</li></ul><p>1157</p><ul><li>A few pounds.</li><li>Did she give you any?</li></ul><p>1158 No.</p><p>1159</p><ul><li>Did you expect to receive any?</li><li>No, sir.</li></ul><p>1160 Did you know that in her new will, you were the beneficiary of L80,000?</p><p>1161 No, I didn&#39;t.</p><p>1162 Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit Mrs French for the last time,</p><p>1163 did you wear a trench coat and a brown hat?</p><p>1164</p><ul><li>Yes, I did.</li><li>Was it this coat and hat?</li></ul><p>1165 Yes, sir.</p><p>1166 My lord, the defence, in its efforts to establish an alibi for the prisoner,</p><p>1167 circulated this photograph, hoping to bring forth a witness</p><p>1168 who had seen him leaving Mrs French&#39;s house or entering his own</p><p>1169 at the times that he has stated.</p><p>1170 Apparently, this splendid effort was without results.</p><p>1171 However, the defence will be pleased to learn</p><p>1172 that, at the last moment, a witness has come forward,</p><p>1173 and that the prisoner had been seen wearing this coat and this hat.</p><p>1174 Lamentably, he had not been seen on the night of the murder but one week before.</p><p>1175 On the afternoon of October 8, were you not in a travel agency in Regent Street?</p><p>1176 And did you not make inquiries about prices and schedules of foreign cruises?</p><p>1177 Supposing I did? It&#39;s not a crime, is it?</p><p>1178 Not at all. Many people go on a cruise when they can afford to pay for it.</p><p>1179</p><ul><li>But you couldn&#39;t pay for it, could you?</li><li>Well, I was hard up. I told you that.</li></ul><p>1180 And yet you came to this particular travel agency with a clinging brunette?</p><p>1181 A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?</p><p>1182 My lord, the lady was so described to me.</p><p>1183 She was very affectionate with the prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.</p><p>1184 Oh.</p><p>1185 You then admit that you made inquiries about expensive and luxurious cruises?</p><p>1186 How did you expect to pay for such a thing?</p><p>1187</p><ul><li>I don&#39;t know. It was...</li><li>If you don&#39;t know, perhaps I can help.</li></ul><p>1188 On the morning of the very same day, you heard Mrs French change her will,</p><p>1189</p><ul><li>leaving you the bulk of her money.</li><li>I didn&#39;t!</li></ul><p>1190 And in the afternoon, you started plans to dispose of it.</p><p>1191 No! It was nothing of the kind.</p><p>1192 I was in a pub and I met a girl. I don&#39;t even remember her name.</p><p>1193 We had a drink and walked out together.</p><p>1194 We passed the window and saw the fancy posters, all blue seas and palm trees.</p><p>1195 The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went in for fun and I started asking for folders.</p><p>1196 Well, the man gave me a funny look because I did look a bit shabby.</p><p>1197 Anyway, it irritated me, so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,</p><p>1198 all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck, but it was just an act!</p><p>1199 An act? You knew that in a week you were going to inherit L80,000!</p><p>1200 No! It wasn&#39;t that way at all. It was make-believe and childish but...</p><p>1201 it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought of killing anyone or inheriting any money.</p><p>1202 It&#39;s just a coincidence that Mrs French should be killed only one week later?</p><p>1203 I told you! I didn&#39;t kill her!</p><p>1204 Do you know any reason why Christine Helm should give the evidence she has</p><p>1205</p><ul><li>if it were not true?</li><li>No. I don&#39;t know why my wife...</li></ul><p>1206 I don&#39;t know why I still call her my wife. She must be lying or out of her mind.</p><p>1207 She seemed remarkably sane and self-possessed.</p><p>1208</p><ul><li>But insanity is all you can suggest?</li><li>I don&#39;t understand it.</li></ul><p>1209 Oh, God! What&#39;s happened? What&#39;s changed her?</p><p>1210 Very effective, I&#39;m sure. But in this court we deal with fact.</p><p>1211 And the fact, Mr Vole, is that we&#39;ve only your word for it.</p><p>1212 That you left Mrs French&#39;s house at the time you say,</p><p>1213 that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes past 9, and that you did not go out again!</p><p>1214 Somebody must have seen me in the street or going in the house!</p><p>1215 One would think so. But the only person who did see you come home that night</p><p>1216 says it was ten past ten and that you had blood on your hands.</p><p>1217</p><ul><li>I cut my wrist!</li><li>You cut your wrist deliberately!</li></ul><p>1218 No, I didn&#39;t! I didn&#39;t do anything.</p><p>1219 But you make it sound as though I did. I can hear it myself.</p><p>1220 You came home at ten past ten!</p><p>1221 No, I didn&#39;t! You&#39;ve got to believe me. You&#39;ve got to believe me!</p><p>1222 You killed Emily French!</p><p>1223 No, I didn&#39;t! I didn&#39;t do it!</p><p>1224 I didn&#39;t kill her! I never killed anybody!</p><p>1225 God, it&#39;s like a nightmare. Some ghastly, horrible dream.</p><p>1226 Good evening, Sir Wilfrid. How did it go today?</p><p>1227 Oh, Sir Wilfrid.</p><p>1228 I&#39;m from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I&#39;ve brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.</p><p>1229 What?</p><p>1230</p><ul><li>You&#39;d better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.</li><li>I&#39;m in the middle of a murder trial.</li></ul><p>1231 It&#39;ll all be over by the afternoon, and the boat train doesn&#39;t go until 9.40.</p><p>1232 You work it out. You know my shape, you&#39;ve stabbed it often enough.</p><p>1233 Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath and your calcium injection.</p><p>1234 And there&#39;s a lot more packing to be done.</p><p>1235 It&#39;s ridiculous having boat reservations. The jury may be out for days.</p><p>1236 Not on this case, I&#39;m afraid. It seems too open-and-shut.</p><p>1237 I watched when Frau Helm was on the stand. They didn&#39;t like her.</p><p>1238 No, but they believed her. They liked Leonard Vole but they didn&#39;t believe him.</p><p>1239 And that travel agency business doesn&#39;t help either. Cigar?</p><p>1240 No.</p><p>1241</p><ul><li>Wilfrid, do you think she lied?</li><li>Well, don&#39;t you?</li></ul><p>1242 I&#39;m not sure.</p><p>1243 I am. She lied. Whether she calls it Meineid or perjury, she lied.</p><p>1244 The only question is why. What&#39;s her game? What is she up to? What?</p><p>1245 I hope that in your final speech you won&#39;t become too emotionally involved.</p><p>1246</p><ul><li>You must think of your condition.</li><li>He&#39;s right.</li></ul><p>1247 I want to see you save yourself. This isn&#39;t going to be your last case.</p><p>1248 Yes, it is. But until it&#39;s over, I&#39;m still a barrister.</p><p>1249 My client&#39;s life is at stake. That&#39;s all that matters - his life.</p><p>1250 He&#39;s entitled to the best that I can do.</p><p>1251 If I can&#39;t stand up to make my final appeal for him, I&#39;ll make it sitting down.</p><p>1252 If I become short of breath I&#39;ll take a pill, or two pills, or all of them and the box too.</p><p>1253</p><ul><li>Yes?</li><li>This Sir Wilfrid Robarts&#39; place?</li></ul><p>1254</p><ul><li>Well, yes, it is.</li><li>Let me talk to the old geezer.</li></ul><p>1255</p><ul><li>Who is this speaking, please?</li><li>Never you mind. Let me talk to &#39;im.</li></ul><p>1256 I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s impossible. What is the nature of your business?</p><p>1257 It&#39;s business all right. I&#39;ve got something to sell &#39;im, I &#39;ave.</p><p>1258 Well, really, madam!</p><p>1259 And what I want to sell &#39;im, believe me, &#39;e&#39;ll want to buy.</p><p>1260</p><ul><li>It&#39;s got to do with that Leonard Vole.</li><li>Leonard Vole?</li></ul><p>1261 It&#39;s about that German wife.</p><p>1262 I&#39;ve got the goods on her and it&#39;s for sale.</p><p>1263 This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking. Now, what is this all about?</p><p>1264 Well, hello, ducky.</p><p>1265 What is this you said about Mrs Leonard Vole?</p><p>1266 I&#39;m not just saying. I&#39;ve got it in black and white.</p><p>1267</p><ul><li>You&#39;ve got what?</li><li>Listen to this carefully, ducks.</li></ul><p>1268 I&#39;m at the buffet at Euston Station at the far end of the bar.</p><p>1269 I&#39;ll be here for 30 minutes because that&#39;s when me train leaves.</p><p>1270 If you want the lowdown on that German bag, get yourself here.</p><p>1271 What lowdown? What do you know about her?</p><p>1272 Uh-uh. Not on the phone.</p><p>1273 You&#39;d better get on over here, and bring plenty of money.</p><p>1274 Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?</p><p>1275 That&#39;s... bilge. Some drunken crank. You get those in every murder trial.</p><p>1276 Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in 30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.</p><p>1277 Balderdash.</p><p>1278 I&#39;m too old and too sick to go on a wild-goose chase.</p><p>1279</p><ul><li>Come on, Mayhew.</li><li>Where to, Sir Wilfrid?</li></ul><p>1280 Euston Station, where do you think?</p><p>1281 Now, sir?</p><p>1282 Shortly.</p><p>1283 Cigar!</p><p>1284 Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?</p><p>1285 Your bath, your massage, your dinner, your injection!</p><p>1286 Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.</p><p>1287</p><ul><li>You wouldn&#39;t be Sir Wilfrid, would you?</li><li>I would.</li></ul><p>1288 Didn&#39;t recognise you without your wig. Lovely you all look in them wigs.</p><p>1289 Two o&#39; yer? I&#39;m not talking to two o&#39; yer.</p><p>1290 This is Mr Mayhew, Leonard Vole&#39;s solicitor.</p><p>1291</p><ul><li>Well, that&#39;s all right, then.</li><li>And your name, please?</li></ul><p>1292 No need for mine. If I did give you a name it mightn&#39;t be the right one, might it?</p><p>1293 &#39;Ave a drink, boys. Two whiskies for me gen&#39;Imen friends.</p><p>1294 Now what is this information you allegedly have?</p><p>1295 You realise that you&#39;re duty-bound to give any evidence that you might have?</p><p>1296</p><ul><li>Come off it. Did you bring any money?</li><li>What is it you have, madam?</li></ul><p>1297 Letters. Letters that German wife of &#39;is wrote. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve got.</p><p>1298</p><ul><li>Letters written to the prisoner?</li><li>To the prisoner? Don&#39;t make me laugh.</li></ul><p>1299 Poor bleeder, he&#39;s been took in by &#39;er all right. And these letters prove it.</p><p>1300 If we could see these letters, we could advise you as to how pertinent they are.</p><p>1301 Well, I don&#39;t expect you...</p><p>1302 Well, as I say, I don&#39;t expect you to buy without seeing, but fair&#39;s fair.</p><p>1303 If these letters get the boy off, it&#39;s L100 for me, right?</p><p>1304 If these letters contain information useful to the defence, I&#39;m prepared to offer L10.</p><p>1305 What? Ten bleeding pounds for letters like these?</p><p>1306 Take that piece of glass out o&#39; yer eye. Good night.</p><p>1307 If these help prove my client&#39;s innocence,</p><p>1308 L20 should, I think, not be an unreasonable sum for your expenses.</p><p>1309 50 and it&#39;s a bargain. That&#39;s if you&#39;re satisfied with &#39;em.</p><p>1310</p><ul><li>L40.</li><li>All right, blast yer.</li></ul><p>1311 &#39;Ere, take &#39;em. Nice little lot there.</p><p>1312 How do we know these are from Mrs Vole?</p><p>1313 Oh, she wrote &#39;em all right. It&#39;s all fair an&#39; square.</p><p>1314 I &#39;ope they fix &#39;er good and proper.</p><p>1315 I&#39;ve had messages from Mrs Vole. It looks like her handwriting.</p><p>1316 Good heavens, look at this.</p><p>1317 Juicy, ain&#39;t they?</p><p>1318</p><ul><li>There&#39;s one that&#39;s even better.</li><li>How did you get hold of these?</li></ul><p>1319 What&#39;s the difference so long as she gets what&#39;s coming?</p><p>1320</p><ul><li>What have you got against her?</li><li>Ha!</li></ul><p>1321 I&#39;ll give you something to dream about, mister.</p><p>1322 Want to kiss me, ducky?</p><p>1323 Ha!</p><p>1324</p><ul><li>I didn&#39;t suppose you would.</li><li>Christine Vole did that to you?</li></ul><p>1325 Not &#39;er, the chap I was going with. He was a bit younger than me but I loved &#39;im.</p><p>1326 Then she come along, started seeing &#39;im on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.</p><p>1327 I found &#39;em together. I said what I thought of &#39;er and he cut me face up proper.</p><p>1328</p><ul><li>Did you go to the police about it?</li><li>Who, me? Not likely.</li></ul><p>1329 It wasn&#39;t &#39;is fault. It was all &#39;ers, gettin&#39; &#39;im away from me, turnin&#39; &#39;im against me.</p><p>1330 But I waited me time to pay &#39;er back. And it&#39;s come now.</p><p>1331 I&#39;m deeply sorry, deeply sorry. We&#39;ll make it another L5 for the letters.</p><p>1332 &#39;Olding out on me, were yer? I knew I was being soft with yer.</p><p>1333 Cold-blooded vindictiveness. Read this one.</p><p>1334 Unbelievable.</p><p>1335 We&#39;d better have the full name of the man to whom these were addressed, Miss...</p><p>1336 Miss, um...</p><p>1337 Where is she?</p><p>1338 On that train, I should think. Doesn&#39;t want her other cheek slashed. Can&#39;t blame her.</p><p>1339</p><ul><li>Care for another, sir?</li><li>Hm?</li></ul><p>1340 Good idea.</p><p>1341 Silence!</p><p>1342 Be upstanding in court.</p><p>1343 All persons who have anything to do before my lords,</p><p>1344 the queen&#39;s justices of oyer and terminer</p><p>1345 and general jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court,</p><p>1346 draw near and give your attendance. God save the queen.</p><p>1347 Since the defence has called but one witness, the prisoner,</p><p>1348 it has the right to be heard last.</p><p>1349 Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have the final address for the prosecution.</p><p>1350 My lord, members of the jury, I will be brief in my final speech</p><p>1351 because I think we&#39;ve proved so obvious a case of murder against Leonard Vole,</p><p>1352 that a verdict of guilty must be the only possible conclusion.</p><p>1353 I will briefly summarise these facts...</p><p>1354 You&#39;d better begin again, Mr Myers.</p><p>1355 That is, if Sir Wilfrid is at all interested in our proceedings.</p><p>1356 I am, indeed, my lord. The speech for the crown, however, is premature.</p><p>1357 I ask that the case for the defence be reopened. And that a witness be recalled.</p><p>1358 I most strenuously object to the case being reopened at this final stage.</p><p>1359 Evidence of a startling nature has come into my possession.</p><p>1360 The course my learned friend proposes is quite unprecedented.</p><p>1361 I have anticipated this objection and can meet it with ample precedent.</p><p>1362 There is the king vs Stillman, reported in the criminal appeal reports of 1926</p><p>1363 at page 463.</p><p>1364 Also, the king vs Porter in volume one of the king&#39;s bench division reports,</p><p>1365 1942 at page 153.</p><p>1366 And lastly there is the case of the king vs Sullivan</p><p>1367 in which this issue was raised, which I&#39;m sure Your Lordship will remember,</p><p>1368 since you appeared for the prosecution.</p><p>1369 I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.</p><p>1370 What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?</p><p>1371 Letters, my lord.</p><p>1372 Letters written by Christine Helm.</p><p>1373 My lord, the prosecution continues its objection.</p><p>1374 If my memory serves me well, Your Lordship&#39;s similar objection</p><p>1375 in the king against Sullivan was sustained.</p><p>1376 Your memory, for once, serves you ill, Mr Myers.</p><p>1377 My objection then was overruled by Mr Justice Swindon.</p><p>1378 As yours is now, by me.</p><p>1379 Call Christine Helm.</p><p>1380 Christine Helm.</p><p>1381</p><ul><li>Christine Helm.</li><li>Christine Helm.</li></ul><p>1382 If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, I wouldn&#39;t mind betting you a box of cigars.</p><p>1383 Mrs Helm, you appreciate you are still under oath?</p><p>1384 Yes.</p><p>1385</p><ul><li>Do you know a man named Max?</li><li>I don&#39;t know what you mean.</li></ul><p>1386 It&#39;s a simple question. Do you or do you not know a man called Max?</p><p>1387 Max? Certainly not.</p><p>1388 It&#39;s a fairly common name and yet you&#39;ve never known a man named Max?</p><p>1389 In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.</p><p>1390 I shall not ask you to go back that far. Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.</p><p>1391</p><ul><li>What have you got there?</li><li>A letter.</li></ul><p>1392 I suggest that on October 20</p><p>1393</p><ul><li>you wrote a letter...</li><li>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.</li></ul><p>1394 ...addressed to a man named Max.</p><ul><li>I did nothing of the sort.</li></ul><p>1395 The letter was but one of a series written to the same man.</p><p>1396 Lies! All lies!</p><p>1397 You seem to have been, well, let us say, on intimate terms with this man.</p><p>1398 How dare you say a thing like that? It isn&#39;t true!</p><p>1399 I&#39;m not concerned with the general trend of this correspondence, only one letter.</p><p>1400 &quot;My beloved Max, an extraordinary thing has happened. &quot;</p><p>1401 &quot;I believe all our difficulties may be ended. &quot;</p><p>1402 I will not stand here and listen to a pack of lies!</p><p>1403 That letter&#39;s a forgery. It isn&#39;t even my letter paper!</p><p>1404</p><ul><li>It isn&#39;t?</li><li>No!</li></ul><p>1405 I write my letters on small blue paper with my initials on it.</p><p>1406 Like this?</p><p>1407 This is a bill from my tailor for a pair of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.</p><p>1408 Wilfrid the fox! That&#39;s what we call him and that&#39;s what he is.</p><p>1409 Now, Mrs Helm, you&#39;ve been kind enough to identify your letter paper.</p><p>1410 Now, if you like, I can have an expert identify your handwriting.</p><p>1411 Damn you!</p><p>1412</p><ul><li>Damn you!</li><li>Leave her alone!</li></ul><p>1413</p><ul><li>Damn you!</li><li>Mrs Helm!</li></ul><p>1414 Let me go! Let me get out of here! Let me go!</p><p>1415</p><ul><li>Mrs Helm!</li><li>Let me go!</li></ul><p>1416 Usher, get the witness a chair.</p><p>1417 Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter in question so that the jury may hear it?</p><p>1418 &quot;My beloved Max, an extraordinary thing has happened. &quot;</p><p>1419 &quot;All our difficulties may soon be solved. &quot;</p><p>1420 &quot;Leonard is suspected of murdering the old lady I told you about. &quot;</p><p>1421 &quot;His only hope of an alibi depends on me and me alone. &quot;</p><p>1422 &quot;Suppose I testify that he was not at home with me at the time of the murder,</p><p>1423 that he came home with blood on his sleeves,</p><p>1424 and that he even admitted to me that he&#39;d killed her?&quot;</p><p>1425 &quot;Strange that he always said he would never let me leave him. &quot;</p><p>1426 &quot;But now, if this succeeds, he will be leaving me</p><p>1427 because they will take him away forever</p><p>1428 and I shall be free and yours, my beloved. &quot;</p><p>1429 &quot;I count the hours until we are together. Christine. &quot;</p><p>1430 Mrs Helm? Will you go back to the witness box?</p><p>1431 I now ask you again, Christine Helm, did you write this letter?</p><p>1432 Christine, tell him you didn&#39;t write it. I know you didn&#39;t.</p><p>1433 Please answer my question. Did you write this letter?</p><p>1434 Before answering, Mrs Helm,</p><p>1435 I wish to warn you that the law regarding perjury in this country is very severe.</p><p>1436 If you have already committed perjury in this courtroom,</p><p>1437 I strongly advise you not to add to your crime.</p><p>1438 But, if this letter has not been written by you,</p><p>1439 then now is the time to state this fact.</p><p>1440 I wrote the letter.</p><p>1441 And that, my lord, is the case for the defence.</p><p>1442 I keep asking which is harder, your head or your arteries?</p><p>1443 Stop pressing your luck, you&#39;re overdue.</p><p>1444 We&#39;re all packed and ready. I hope the jury won&#39;t take all afternoon.</p><p>1445 I concede.</p><p>1446</p><ul><li>Congratulations, here are your cigars.</li><li>Not yet.</li></ul><p>1447 Come on, it&#39;s all over, wrapped up neat and tidy.</p><p>1448</p><ul><li>What&#39;s wrong?</li><li>It&#39;s a little too neat, too tidy,</li></ul><p>1449 and altogether too symmetrical, that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with it.</p><p>1450</p><ul><li>The jury is back.</li><li>You&#39;re not worried about the verdict?</li></ul><p>1451 It&#39;s not their judgment that worries me, it&#39;s mine.</p><p>1452 Come along.</p><p>1453 Where&#39;s my wig?</p><p>1454 The prisoner will stand up.</p><p>1455 Members of the jury, are you all agreed upon your verdict?</p><p>1456 We are.</p><p>1457 Do you find the prisoner at the bar, Leonard Stephen Vole,</p><p>1458 guilty or not guilty of the murder of Emily Jane French?</p><p>1459 Not guilty, m&#39;lord.</p><p>1460 Silence!</p><p>1461 Silence!</p><p>1462 Leonard Stephen Vole, you have been found not guilty</p><p>1463 of the murder of Emily Jane French on October 14.</p><p>1464 You are hereby discharged and are free to leave the court.</p><p>1465 Persons with anything more to do before the queen&#39;s justices</p><p>1466 of oyer and terminer and jail delivery</p><p>1467 for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court may depart the area.</p><p>1468 Thank you. Yes, we&#39;ll talk later. Thank you, Mr Mayhew.</p><p>1469 Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.</p><p>1470 Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything. You were wonderful.</p><p>1471</p><ul><li>I&#39;d say we were lucky all around.</li><li>Yeah.</li></ul><p>1472 I have your belongings. Sign the receipt, Mr Vole, and we can release you.</p><p>1473 &quot;Mr Vole. &quot; They didn&#39;t call me Mr when they charged me.</p><p>1474</p><ul><li>I&#39;ll go with you, I have your hat and coat.</li><li>Let&#39;s go before they change their mind!</li></ul><p>1475 Chipper, isn&#39;t he? An hour ago, he had one foot on the gallows</p><p>1476 and the other on a banana peel.</p><p>1477 You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid. Aren&#39;t you?</p><p>1478 Not yet. We&#39;ve disposed of the gallows,</p><p>1479 but there&#39;s still that banana peel somewhere, under somebody&#39;s foot.</p><p>1480</p><ul><li>Every word you said was a lie!</li><li>You ought to be locked up! Liar!</li></ul><p>1481 You&#39;d better wait here until we get rid of that crowd, madam.</p><p>1482 Thank you.</p><p>1483 Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.</p><p>1484 Let me finish the last of the cocoa while I&#39;m still beyond her jurisdiction.</p><p>1485 Would you excuse me, Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.</p><p>1486 I never thought you British could get so emotional. Especially in public.</p><p>1487</p><ul><li>I apologise for my compatriots.</li><li>It&#39;s all right.</li></ul><p>1488 I don&#39;t mind being called names or pushed around or even kicked in the shin.</p><p>1489 But I have a ladder in my last pair of nylons.</p><p>1490 In case you are not familiar with our prison regulations, no silk stockings.</p><p>1491 Prison? Will I go to prison?</p><p>1492 You heard the judge. You will certainly be charged with perjury,</p><p>1493</p><ul><li>tried for it, and to prison you shall go.</li><li>Well, it won&#39;t be for life, will it?</li></ul><p>1494 If I were appearing for the prosecution, it would be.</p><p>1495 You loathe me, don&#39;t you? Like the people outside.</p><p>1496 What a wicked woman I am, and how brilliantly you exposed me</p><p>1497 and saved Leonard&#39;s life. The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.</p><p>1498 Well, let me tell you something. You didn&#39;t do it alone. You had help.</p><p>1499 What are you driving at?</p><p>1500 I&#39;m not driving at anything. Leonard is free and we did it.</p><p>1501</p><ul><li>We?</li><li>Remember?</li></ul><p>1502 When you said that no jury would believe an alibi given by a loving wife,</p><p>1503 no matter how much she swore he was innocent? That gave me the idea.</p><p>1504 What idea?</p><p>1505 The idea that I should be a witness, not for my husband, but for the prosecution.</p><p>1506 That I should swear Leonard was guilty and that you should expose me as a liar</p><p>1507 because only then would they believe Leonard was innocent.</p><p>1508 So now you know the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.</p><p>1509 I&#39;ll give yer something to dream about, mister.</p><p>1510 Want to kiss me, ducky?</p><p>1511 I suspected something, but not that.</p><p>1512</p><ul><li>Never that!</li><li>Thank you for the compliment.</li></ul><p>1513 It&#39;s been a long time since I acted and I never played such a vital role.</p><p>1514 All those blue letters!</p><p>1515 It took me hours to write them, to invent Max. There never was a Max.</p><p>1516 There&#39;s never been anyone but Leonard.</p><p>1517 My dear, could you not have trusted me,</p><p>1518 worked with me truthfully and honourably? We would have won.</p><p>1519 I could not run that risk. You thought he was innocent.</p><p>1520 And you knew he was innocent. I understand.</p><p>1521 No, Sir Wilfrid, you do not understand at all.</p><p>1522 I knew he was guilty.</p><p>1523 That can&#39;t be true! No!</p><p>1524 Listen to me, once and for all.</p><p>1525 He came home after ten, he had blood on his sleeves,</p><p>1526 he said he had killed the woman, only I could save him. He pleaded.</p><p>1527 And you saved him? A murderer?</p><p>1528 Again, you don&#39;t understand.</p><p>1529 I love him.</p><p>1530 I told you she was an actress. And a good one.</p><p>1531 Leonard!</p><p>1532 I knew she&#39;d do something, but I just didn&#39;t know what or how.</p><p>1533 Leonard, Leonard.</p><p>1534</p><ul><li>Fooled you completely, didn&#39;t she?</li><li>It was you, Vole, who fooled me.</li></ul><p>1535 Oh, easy. Easy. We both got out of this alive, let&#39;s stay this way.</p><p>1536</p><ul><li>Where are your pills?</li><li>You&#39;ve made a mockery of English law.</li></ul><p>1537 Who did? You got me off and I can&#39;t be tried again for this.</p><p>1538</p><ul><li>That&#39;s English law too, isn&#39;t it?</li><li>You can&#39;t touch him now. Nobody can.</li></ul><p>1539 The scales of justice may tip one way or another,</p><p>1540 but ultimately they balance out. You&#39;ll pay for this.</p><p>1541 Ultimately&#39;s a long way off. I&#39;d rather pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.</p><p>1542 Suppose we double your fee? There&#39;ll be lots of money once the will goes through.</p><p>1543 I&#39;m not cheap, I want everybody to get something out of it.</p><p>1544 There&#39;s Janet McKenzie. We&#39;ll get her that new hearing aid.</p><p>1545 And we&#39;ll get you a new one of these. 18-carat gold if they make them.</p><p>1546 And when they try you for perjury there&#39;ll be L5,000 for the defence.</p><p>1547 I don&#39;t care, just so we&#39;ll be together. You don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve been through.</p><p>1548 Standing in the witness box, having to face you, saying I never loved you.</p><p>1549 What is it, Leonard?</p><p>1550 The luggage is in the car and we&#39;ve only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.</p><p>1551 This is a nice young lady I met during the trial.</p><p>1552 Len!</p><p>1553 Oh, Len!</p><p>1554 Len...</p><p>1555 Oh, Len, they&#39;ve been trying to keep me away. It&#39;s had me nearly crazy.</p><p>1556 Leonard, who&#39;s this girl?</p><p>1557 I&#39;m not this girl, I&#39;m his girl.</p><p>1558 Tell her, Len.</p><p>1559 Leonard, is this the girl who was with you in the travel bureau?</p><p>1560 The girl you said you hardly knew, didn&#39;t even know her name?</p><p>1561 That&#39;s right. That&#39;s who I am and I know all about you. You&#39;re not his wife.</p><p>1562 Never have been. You&#39;re years older than he is. We&#39;ve been together for months</p><p>1563 and we&#39;re going away on a cruise, just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.</p><p>1564</p><ul><li>Yes, Len, tell me yourself.</li><li>All right, Diana, come along.</li></ul><p>1565 You can&#39;t, not after what I&#39;ve done. I won&#39;t let you.</p><p>1566 I saved your life getting you out of Germany,</p><p>1567 you got me out of this mess, so we&#39;re even. It&#39;s over now.</p><p>1568 Don&#39;t, Leonard! Don&#39;t leave me! Don&#39;t, Leonard! Don&#39;t!</p><p>1569 Pull yourself together.
